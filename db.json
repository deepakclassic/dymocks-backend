    "question": "What is diffusion?",
    "answer": "Diffusion is the process of one substance gradually spreading out and mixing with another substance. It is a form of passive transport, meaning that no external energy is required for the molecules to move from one place to another. Diffusion is a natural process that can take place in gases, liquids, and solids."

  "q4": {
    "question": "What is the law of conservation of mass?",
    "answer": "The law of conservation of mass states that matter can be neither created nor destroyed. This implies that all the mass in a system remains constant, as mass can be transferred but not destroyed. This law is an important part of chemistry and physics."

  "q10": {
    "question": "What is a chemical reaction?",
    "answer": "A chemical reaction is a process in which one set of chemical substances are converted into another set of substances, with different properties."
